I this chapter we will explore how to create and use lighting effects in the ivf2 library. Lighting is essential for creating realistic scenes, as it affects how objects are rendered and perceived by the viewer. The ivf2 library provides various types of lights, including ambient, directional, point, and spotlights, which can be used to illuminate the scene.
